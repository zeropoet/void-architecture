  <p>More people, more data, more noise — none of it matters if it doesn’t touch something real inside. What we all truly need is to feel and to be felt — to be known in a way that isn’t about transaction or performance. Peace begins when what we experience and what we understand come together, steady and alive, and in that space, we can finally share something real.</p>
